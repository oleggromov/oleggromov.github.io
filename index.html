          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">Published on February 26, 2017</div><p>В начале этой недели я переехал в Лос-Анджелес, чтобы учить английский — на полгода, если следовать первоначальному плану. Цели перебраться сюда (в США) насовсем у меня не было и нет, но мысли такие, разумеется, проскакивают. В мечтах, взявшихся преимущественно из сериала Californication и отчасти из поп-культуры вроде клипов и маек из Pull &amp; Bear, Лос-Анджелес представлялся райским местом. Мегаполис с вечным летом, на берегу океана, в Южной Калифорнии. На деле всё оказалось, естественно, не совсем так.</p>
<p>Лос-Анджелес (а точнее весь округ, LA County) очень большой, размазанный по побережью и предгорьям. Живут тут преимущественно в частных домиках, как и везде в Америке (это вам не Нью-Йорк!). Все ездят на машинах. Людей на тротуарах нет! Конечно, есть подходящие для пешеходов островки жизни, но их я пока нашёл всего несколько штук. Скамеек на улицах нет, сидит народ только в уличных кафе, но и тех на улице раз-два и обчёлся. Не Италия.</p>

          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">Published on February 16, 2017</div><p><em>During almost all of my life</em>, I used to judge everything I encountered. Among usual subjects to judge were people with their decisions and opinions, computer technologies, books and movies, ideas from anyone and anywhere, even the vaguest ones—that were better to explore rather than evaluate. Short story long, I’ve thought I knew everything and tried to live according to that principle. Anytime I was hit by anything new, I tried to do my best just to fit that event into the system I was already familiar with. My own judgment and decision-making matrix.</p>
<p>Whether the event was positive or negative, brought me something useful or hurt, I was instantly up to put a particular label onto it. Just good or bad. Nothing worth craving. Too shallow or way profound for such a simple idea. Stupid. Jerk. Asshole. Or even the-future-mother-of-my-children-and-fuck-what-you-could-think-about-it. As you’ve probably noticed already, I was hardly to be called an easy-going positive thinking person. And despite the fact I hate self-help crap filled with affirmations, the way I used to perceive the world was neither useful nor pleasant.</p>

          <h1><a href="/notes/2017-01-abandoning-blogging">Abandoning Blogging</a></h1>
          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">Published on January 30, 2017</div><p>I’ve tried to maintain a blog a few times during the last 8-10 years. First, I had nothing to write about. Then I had a great idea to write about projects I’ve been working on as a freelance developer, but I haven’t had enough really good projects to be proud of. Neither I had enough passion to write about my job because it turned out to be another job itself and take too much time for a guy who earned money for coding, not writing. I also tried to <a href="http://rawgift.livejournal.com"  target="_blank">write about my personal experiences, particularly in Russian</a>, which was probably a good idea, but I abandoned it quickly.</p>
<p>About a year ago, in the beginning of 2016, I took another attempt to write. That time, it was about my experience as a professional software developer at Yandex. Potentially, the job and tasks I was responsible for were, and still are, very interesting. Sometimes hard and sometimes not, with tough and loose deadlines, all of them were more about juggling with lots of different parts: figuring out what to do; decomposing projects into individual tasks; managing people to make them understand the meaning of the task, and finally making sure they&#39;d done the job as was intended. I was a manager, not just a developer who had lots of time to spend on coding. But I wanted to write about coding challenges actually not having them in real life! That attempt failed too.</p>

          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">Published on August 27, 2016</div><p>Today I share with you the list of non-development articles which I collected during the last few weeks. There&#39;s a very interesting narration by Remy Sharp about his experience in creating and maintaining JSBin, useful articles on time perception and human psycology, some intriguing physics discoveries and wonders of the nature and finally a link to the NYC pictures pinned to the map.</p>

          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">Published on August 18, 2016</div><p>This time I decided to separate all related to software development stuff from personal and other things that are interesting but are off the topic.</p>
<p>Here is a huge list of articles which I, by means of some unknown magic (even for me!), could read in the course of the past week. The most interesting and fun story which I&#39;d like to start with is <a href="http://www.montulli.org/theoriginofthe%3Cblink%3Etag"  target="_blank">the history of the <code>blink</code> tag</a>. This is an amazing read of the kind I like most of all: an amusing story on something very related to me and my experience (of course, technologies and guys who invented them). Must read for everyone!</p>

          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">Published on February 9, 2016</div><p>Imagine you’re writing an algorithm which performs looping over an array with any type of pointer (<code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop, <code>forEach</code>, <code>map</code> etc). Each iteration the pointer moves in any direction, but you never force it to come back in the most of cases. Why should you? This mode of manipulating data is so much usual that your probably have never ever thought of its liability to hard-to-find annoying errors which will lead you toward wearing debugging!</p>
<p>The erroneous pattern is very simple and obvious. Say you need to map some action to all array elements and write.</p>
