          </div><p>While working on one of my inspirational OSS projects, I found out that there&#39;s currently no way to observe element style changes. At least I couldn&#39;t find any mentions of library-like solutions for that. I assume that the reason for that might be the fact it&#39;s hard to understand whether or not the styles have changed.</p>
<p>So, I decided to write my own library and called it <code>SauronStyle</code>. Please take a look and <a href="https://github.com/oleggromov/sauron-style"  target="_blank">give it a try</a> if you need anything like that for your project.</p>

          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">Published in <a href="/notes/">Notes</a> on July 2, 2017
          </div><p>There is a widely held notion, and I agree, that declarative code is better than imperative. It is less error-prone, usually much more eloquent and neat and thus much more maintainable. It is a good principle to follow on a day-to-day basis when you use existing declarative libraries like the JavaScript standard library (<code>Array</code>/<code>Object</code> methods etc.), underscore/lodash or React. However, when it comes to making a decision to either write some declarative code (and therefore much more generalized) or just leave an imperative ad hoc solution, I suggest thinking at least twice.</p>
<p>Every algorithm has specific complexity; not only does it have computational complexity (declared by means of time/memory it takes to run on different input sizes), but also a <em>complexity of writing and understanding the code</em> that implements it. The latter primarily falls to programmers who work with the code, and in the world of budgets and deadlines is also a valid point of concern.</p>

          </div><p>В конце каждого 3-месячного модуля студенты Columbia West College отправляются на недельные каникулы. В прошлый раз я ездил исследовать Bay Area, в этот раз — решил поехать дальше, в Портленд, штат Орегон. Расстояние по Interstate-5 от Лос-Анджелеса до Портленда — около 960 миль, то есть полторы тысячи километров. За день проехать можно (и поначалу казалось, что придётся по пути назад), но сложно, поэтому первая остановка была в Bay Area, в городке под названием Hayward — чтобы заодно повидать напоследок друзей, живущих неподалёку, в Бёркли.</p>
<p>I-5, в отличие от легендарного и живописного Highway 1, идущего по побережью Тихого Океана, дорога прямая и скучная. Как только выезжаешь из Лос-Анджелеса и проезжаешь первые горы, начинаются калифорнийские поля (похоже на Ростовскую область или Краснодарский край, только есть горы на горизонте), виноградники и плодовые сады (ни на что не похоже). Температура в тени на этот раз была сумасшедшая, около 40 градусов выше нуля. На улице баня! Легендарная калифорнийская жара наконец-то показала себя во всей красе — чем дальше вглубь континента от океана, тем жарче. И эта температура относительно нормальная для лета в Калифорнии.</p>

          </div><p>В начале прошлой недели я <em>переехал</em> в Лос-Анджелес, чтобы учить английский — на полгода, если следовать первоначальному плану. Цели перебраться сюда (в США) насовсем у меня не было и нет, но мысли такие, разумеется, проскакивают. В мечтах, взявшихся преимущественно из сериала Californication и отчасти из поп-культуры вроде клипов и маек из Pull &amp; Bear, Лос-Анджелес представлялся райским местом. Мегаполис с вечным летом, на берегу океана, в Южной Калифорнии. На деле всё оказалось, естественно, не совсем так.</p>
<p>Лос-Анджелес (а точнее весь округ, LA County) очень большой, размазанный по побережью и предгорьям. Живут тут преимущественно в частных домиках, как и везде в Америке (это вам не Манхэттен!). Все ездят на машинах. Людей на тротуарах нет! Конечно, есть подходящие для пешеходов островки жизни, но их я пока нашёл всего несколько штук. Скамеек на улицах нет, сидит народ только в уличных кафе, но и тех на улице раз-два и обчёлся. Не Италия.</p>

          </div><p>During almost all of my life, I used to judge everything I encountered. Among usual subjects to judge were people with their decisions and opinions, computer technologies, books and movies, ideas from anyone and anywhere, even the vaguest ones—that were better to explore rather than evaluate. Short story long, I’ve thought I knew everything and tried to live according to that principle. Anytime I was hit by anything new, I tried to do my best just to fit that event into the system I was already familiar with. My own judgment and decision-making matrix.</p>
<p>Whether the event was positive or negative, brought me something useful or hurt, I was instantly up to put a particular label onto it. Just good or bad. Nothing worth craving. Too shallow or way profound for such a simple idea. Stupid. Jerk. Asshole. Or even the-future-mother-of-my-children-and-fuck-what-you-could-think-about-it. As you’ve probably noticed already, I was hardly to be called an easy-going positive thinking person. And despite the fact I hate self-help crap filled with affirmations, the way I used to perceive the world was neither useful nor pleasant.</p>

          </div><p>I’ve tried to maintain a blog a few times during the last 8-10 years. First, I had nothing to write about. Then I had a great idea to write about projects I’ve been working on as a freelance developer, but I haven’t had enough really good projects to be proud of. Neither I had enough passion to write about my job because it turned out to be another job itself and take too much time for a guy who earned money for coding, not writing. I also tried to <a href="http://rawgift.livejournal.com"  target="_blank">write about my personal experiences, particularly in Russian</a>, which was probably a good idea, but I abandoned it quickly.</p>
<p>About a year ago, in the beginning of 2016, I took another attempt to write. That time, it was about my experience as a professional software developer at Yandex. Potentially, the job and tasks I was responsible for were, and still are, very interesting. Sometimes hard and sometimes not, with tough and loose deadlines, all of them were more about juggling with lots of different parts: figuring out what to do; decomposing projects into individual tasks; managing people to make them understand the meaning of the task, and finally making sure they&#39;d done the job as was intended. I was a manager, not just a developer who had lots of time to spend on coding. But I wanted to write about coding challenges actually not having them in real life! That attempt failed too.</p>
