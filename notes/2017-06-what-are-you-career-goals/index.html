<p><em>I&#39;ve recently joined a developer community <a href="https://dev.to"  target="_blank">dev.to</a>. It is a really nice place where people spur discussions and ask questions that&#39;re not only related to technologies and software development but are incredibly important as well, for us as human beings constantly looking for the meaning. One of these questions is a moving &quot;What are your career goals?&quot;.</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent a decent hour writing and polishing the answer and it turns out to be so important and concise that I&#39;d like to publish it on my own website. Publish in order not to lose it, share it with people who&#39;re interested in me and emphasize this incredibly important reasoning I&#39;ve happily derived from my lastest experience. I hope my thoughts might be even helpful for those who constantly question their careers and even themselves.</p>
<p>My answer to the <a href="https://dev.to/jtvanwage/what-are-your-career-goals"  target="_blank">original question</a> is below.</p>
<h2 id="the-answer">The Answer</h2>
<p>This is one of my favorite questions I always enjoy asking myself and whoever related to the tech I happen to speak with.</p>
<p>If I was asked before I quit my last job in February this year I would be absolutely unsure. I had an intention to quit for about 2 years in a row after I&#39;d finally paid off all my debts and started saving money instead of wasting it. The reason to quit was that the job was well-paid but not fulfilling and I felt bad because there was no growth but a lot of stress. And the most important, <em>after I first got my paid developer job more than 10 years ago I had been never really sure anymore if I was still passionate about it and if it was a &quot;right&quot; thing to do with my life</em>. It took me 2 years to finally make the decision to quit and take a half-a-year long vacation to calm down and find out what I&#39;d want.</p>
<p>I guess it has worked out and I&#39;ve come up with a few conclusions. First off, feeling fulfilled and useful is more about <em>how</em> you approach problems than <em>what</em> problems you solve. Both are crucial but I don&#39;t actually believe in anything like destiny unless you&#39;re the one who creates it, so while you&#39;re dealing with arbitrary problems you happened to face you still want to be enthusiastic, learn and develop your skills and communicate with others in a meaningful and deep way. Here&#39;s a potential growth point: change your attitude and see what happens to your job. Maybe it becomes much more beautiful than before.</p>
<p>On top of it, I often confused dissatisfaction and disappointment related to the people I&#39;d dealt with and the responsibilities I&#39;d had. In my experience, the right people nearby bring much more satisfaction than the &quot;right&quot; things you do. Apparently it&#39;s much more important to work with people you like and be a part of a helpful and encouraging community. Exactly like dev.to. Thanks a lot for being around, folks!</p>
<p>The next crucial thing is learning. I enjoy it even though it took me a long time to figure out how to handle frustration because of inevitable mistakes you make while dealing with something new and start enjoying the process and the results. Now I&#39;m going to continue my formal computer science/math education to acquire knowledge and skills I need to solve more complex problems. While doing that, I will clearly need some freelance/remote job in order to pay my bills but this thing must stay in the background in order not to substitute meaningful movement with a routine work. At this point, the way I&#39;ve chosen becomes really tough but there&#39;s no other way I could come up with. I&#39;ll just have to manage it.</p>
<p>All that being said, I&#39;ve finally come to the point when I can answer the original question. The career goal for the next 5-10 years is to make (or at least participate in) a profitable software company that ships a useful product that I have affection for. I&#39;ve already planned out building prototypes/MVPs for different ideas I have and throwing them into the wild to find out if people like them or not. I love the idea of meritocratic entrepreneurship in tech!</p>
<p>However, I try to stay realistic and keep my feet on the ground. All these ideas I have might fail. Even if it happens, as long as I manage to stay passionate and curious about the development, keep learning and acquire new useful skills, make something meaningful and spend time with nice and smart people I must be fine - whatever I&#39;ll happen to do.</p>
