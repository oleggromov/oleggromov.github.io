          </div><p>В конце каждого 3-месячного модуля студенты Columbia West College отправляются на недельные каникулы. В прошлый раз я ездил исследовать Bay Area, в этот раз — решил поехать дальше, в Портленд, штат Орегон. Расстояние по Interstate-5 от Лос-Анджелеса до Портленда — около 960 миль, то есть полторы тысячи километров. За день проехать можно (и поначалу казалось, что придётся по пути назад), но сложно, поэтому первая остановка была в Bay Area, в городке под названием Hayward — чтобы заодно повидать напоследок друзей, живущих неподалёку, в Бёркли.</p>
<p>I-5, в отличие от легендарного и живописного Highway 1, идущего по побережью Тихого Океана, дорога прямая и скучная. Как только выезжаешь из Лос-Анджелеса и проезжаешь первые горы, начинаются калифорнийские поля (похоже на Ротовскую область или Краснодарский край, только есть горы на горизонте), виноградники и плодовые сады (ни на что не похоже). Температура в тени на этот раз была сумасшедшая, около 40 градусов выше нуля. На улице баня! Легендарная калифорнийская жара наконец-то показала себя во всей красе — чем дальше вглубь континента от океана, тем жарче. И эта температура относительно нормальная для лета в Калифорнии.</p>

One of these questions is a moving &quot;What are your career goals?&quot;.</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent a decent hour writing and polishing the answer and it turns out to be so important and concise that I&#39;d like to publish it on my own website. Publish in order not to lose it, share it with people who&#39;re interested in me and emphasize this incredibly important reasoning I&#39;ve happily derived from my lastest experience.

It may contain mistakes I had made with no reason to fool anyone but by accident. The main reason for this essay to exist is the need to excercise in writing convincing and well shaped pieces of text.

<p>Milton Friedman once said, “The poor stay poor not because they’re lazy, but because they have no access to capital”. Even though it seems to be obvious from a capitalistic standpoint, I claim that capital can only help after the system itself will have been transformed from within.</p>

          </div><p>During almost all of my life, I used to judge everything I encountered. Among usual subjects to judge were people with their decisions and opinions, computer technologies, books and movies, ideas from anyone and anywhere, even the vaguest ones—that were better to explore rather than evaluate. Short story long, I’ve thought I knew everything and tried to live according to that principle. Anytime I was hit by anything new, I tried to do my best just to fit that event into the system I was already familiar with. My own judgment and decision-making matrix.</p>
<p>Whether the event was positive or negative, brought me something useful or hurt, I was instantly up to put a particular label onto it. Just good or bad. Nothing worth craving. Too shallow or way profound for such a simple idea. Stupid. Jerk. Asshole. Or even the-future-mother-of-my-children-and-fuck-what-you-could-think-about-it. As you’ve probably noticed already, I was hardly to be called an easy-going positive thinking person. And despite the fact I hate self-help crap filled with affirmations, the way I used to perceive the world was neither useful nor pleasant.</p>

          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">Published in <a href="/notes/">Notes</a> on January 30, 2017
          </div><p>I’ve tried to maintain a blog a few times during the last 8-10 years. First, I had nothing to write about. Then I had a great idea to write about projects I’ve been working on as a freelance developer, but I haven’t had enough really good projects to be proud of. Neither I had enough passion to write about my job because it turned out to be another job itself and take too much time for a guy who earned money for coding, not writing. I also tried to <a href="http://rawgift.livejournal.com"  target="_blank">write about my personal experiences, particularly in Russian</a>, which was probably a good idea, but I abandoned it quickly.</p>
<p>About a year ago, in the beginning of 2016, I took another attempt to write. That time, it was about my experience as a professional software developer at Yandex. Potentially, the job and tasks I was responsible for were, and still are, very interesting. Sometimes hard and sometimes not, with tough and loose deadlines, all of them were more about juggling with lots of different parts: figuring out what to do; decomposing projects into individual tasks; managing people to make them understand the meaning of the task, and finally making sure they&#39;d done the job as was intended. I was a manager, not just a developer who had lots of time to spend on coding. But I wanted to write about coding challenges actually not having them in real life! That attempt failed too.</p>

<p>Here is a huge list of articles which I, by means of some unknown magic (even for me!), could read in the course of the past week. The most interesting and fun story which I&#39;d like to start with is <a href="http://www.montulli.org/theoriginofthe%3Cblink%3Etag"  target="_blank">the history of the <code>blink</code> tag</a>. This is an amazing read of the kind I like most of all: an amusing story on something very related to me and my experience (of course, technologies and guys who invented them). Must read for everyone!</p>

          </div><p>Imagine you’re writing an algorithm which performs looping over an array with any type of pointer (<code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop, <code>forEach</code>, <code>map</code> etc). Each iteration the pointer moves in any direction, but you never force it to come back in the most of cases. Why should you? This mode of manipulating data is so much usual that your probably have never ever thought of its liability to hard-to-find annoying errors which will lead you toward wearing debugging!</p>
<p>The erroneous pattern is very simple and obvious. Say you need to map some action to all array elements and write.</p>
