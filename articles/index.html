          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">August 27, 2016</div><p>Today I share with you the list of non-development articles which I collected during the last few weeks. There&#39;s a very interesting narration by Remy Sharp about his experience in creating and maintaining JSBin, useful articles on time perception and human psycology, some intriguing physics discoveries and wonders of the nature and finally a link to the NYC pictures pinned to the map.</p>

          <h1><a href="/articles/developers-bookmarks-1">Developer&#39;s bookmarks #1: progressive web apps, automated testing pyramid, thoughts about good code and some CSS fun</a></h1>
          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">August 18, 2016</div><p>This time I decided to separate all related to software development stuff from personal and other things that are interesting but are off the topic.</p>
<p>Here is a huge list of articles which I, by means of some unknown magic (even for me!), could read in the course of the past week. The most interesting and fun story which I&#39;d like to start with is <a href="http://www.montulli.org/theoriginofthe%3Cblink%3Etag"  target="_blank">the history of the <code>blink</code> tag</a>. This is an amazing read of the kind I like most of all: an amusing story on something very related to me and my experience (of course, technologies and guys who invented them). Must read for everyone!</p>

          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">August 7, 2016</div><p>This week&#39;s bookmarks list can be way more interesting for programmers than the previous one because there&#39;s one very interesting historical narration and some links about front-end development. There&#39;re also some links for those who like science and is interested in world&#39;s experience of avoiding traffic jams.</p>

But what about should I write if no great article is finished yet but there&#39;s blog, and it is waiting? Certainly about things that are worth reading, seeing and knowing about.</p>

          <h1><a href="/articles/the-splice-error-pattern">The splice error pattern</a></h1>
          <div class="article__date article__date_preview">February 9, 2016</div><p>Imagine youâ€™re writing an algorithm which performs looping over an array with any type of pointer (<code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop, <code>forEach</code>, <code>map</code> etc). Each iteration the pointer moves in any direction, but you never force it to come back in the most of cases. Why should you? This mode of manipulating data is so much usual that your probably have never ever thought of its liability to hard-to-find annoying errors which will lead you toward wearing debugging!</p>
<p>The erroneous pattern is very simple and obvious. Say you need to map some action to all array elements and write.</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedjavascript">var arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.forEach(act);

function act(item) {
    console.log(item);
}
</code></pre>
